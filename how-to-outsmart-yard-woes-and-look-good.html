						<h1 class="h2">How to Outsmart Yard Woes</h1>
						<h2 class="h4">And Look Good in Calgary</h2>
						<p>Maybe you're tired of losing plants to late frosts, watching your lawn crisp up in a dry spell, or
							wrestling with wind that undoes your hard work. If you're wondering how to keep your outdoor space
							both tough and attractive, Japanese garden techniques might have the answers &mdash; no Zen raking
							required.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">Hire Plants That Won't Quit</h3>
						<p>Calgary's winters are no joke. Amur Maple and Japanese Tree Lilac are up for it, giving you colour
							and structure even after a deep freeze. For extra resilience, try Rosy Lights Azaleas, Annabelle
							Hydrangea, or the Wild Rose of Alberta.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">Live With The Season</h3>
						<p>For reliable, seasonal colour in Calgary, consider hardy perennials like Asters, Rudbeckia, Sedum,
							Helenium, Echinacea, Perennial Sunflowers (such as Helianthus 'Lemon Queen'), Russian Sage, or
							hardy Chrysanthemums. These plants bloom late, withstand local weather swings, and keep your garden
							vibrant even when summer is short. Saskatoon Berry and Magic Carpet Spirea add colour as well,
							making the most of Calgary's growing season. If you want to stretch your season further, high
							tunnels or cloches can help protect your plants from early frosts.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">Water Without the Stress</h3>
						<p>Dry gardens of gravel, rocks, and boulders aren't just for show. They save water and keep
							maintenance low. Dry stream beds help with runoff, and rain barrels let you collect water for dry
							spells, all while keeping things simple.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">Better Soil For Lasting Yields</h3>
						<p>Healthy soil is the secret to a thriving garden. Compost boosts texture and drainage, and raised
							beds help fussy plants like Japanese Blood Grass. Calgary Carpet Juniper and Blue Fox Willow are
							low maintenance groundcovers that just work here.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">Block the Chinooks, Not the View</h3>
						<p>Windbreaks matter. Bamboo fences and stone walls are classic in Japan, but here, you can plant
							Colorado Blue Spruce or Swedish Aspen to help block gusts and add structure all year.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">Handle the Highs and Lows</h3>
						<p>Calgary's altitude and sun are tough. Rocky Mountain Juniper and Mugo Pine can take it. UV blocking
							row covers help sensitive plants survive the extremes.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">Don't Sweat the Swings</h3>
						<p>Temperature swings are part of life here. Koi ponds with insulating covers can help, and sunflowers
							or Bristlecone Pine bring colour and durability, no matter the weather.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">So, What's the Move for Calgary Gardeners?</h3>
						<p>You don't have to settle for a yard that's all work and no wow. Try out a few of these Japanese
							inspired fixes, see what works for you, and share your results. Calgary's climate is tough, but
							your yard can still look great, and make your life easier.</p>
