                  <h1 class="h4">What If Your Yard Could Be</h1>
                  <h2 class="h6">Something More Than Just Grass?</h2>
                  <p>Don't get me wrong! Calgary's big lawns are perfect for a picnic or a game of catch. But what if
                     your outdoor space could offer something different: A place to unwind, reflect, and enjoy a little
                     peace, without breaking the bank?</p>
                  <p>Okay, I get it. Here's how you can start turning your lawn into a Japanese inspired garden, one
                     easy step at a time.</p>
                  <h3 class="h6">Test the Waters, Then Swim</h3>
                  <p>No need to overhaul your whole yard at once. Pick a corner or a strip along the fence as your "safe
                     test zone". Swap out some grass for low maintenance ground covers like clover or creeping thyme.
                     These plants stay green, need less water, and give you a feel for the change without a big
                     commitment.</p>
                  <h3 class="h6">Style It the Japanese Way</h3>
                  <p>Ready to go further? Sprinkle in some Japanese flair. Start simple! A few decorative stones, a
                     patch of gravel, or a bamboo border. Check out local garden centers and find online deals, no need
                     to splurge. These touches hint at the calm, minimalist look of a Japanese garden, and you can
                     always add more later.</p>
                  <h3 class="h6">Zen Yourself and Your Garden</h3>
                  <p>Every great garden needs a place to pause. Set up a small bench, a couple of flat stones for
                     seating, or even a planter with a maple tree or a bonsai. These cozy nooks don't take up much space
                     or budget, but they give you a peaceful spot to relax in your own backyard.</p>
                  <h3 class="h6">Green Up the Smart Way</h3>
                  <p>Choose native plants that thrive in Calgary's climate. They'll need less water and attention,
                     saving you time and money. Want to take it further? Start a compost bin. It's a simple way to feed
                     your soil, cut down on waste, and keep your garden healthy, naturally.</p>
                  <h3 class="h6">Budget Your Creativity</h3>
                  <p>Transforming your yard doesn't mean emptying your wallet. Try garden swaps, yard sales, or DIY
                     projects for supplies. Trade plants and materials with neighbours, or repurpose what you already
                     have. Sometimes the best features are the ones you make yourself.</p>
                  <h3 class="h6">Success, Rinse, Repeat</h3>
                  <p>As your garden takes shape, celebrate! Post your progress on social media, invite friends over, or
                     just enjoy the view. If you love the results, expand a little more each season. Soon, you'll have a
                     garden that's uniquely yours, with just the right balance of lawn and Zen.</p>
                  <p>Who says your yard can't be part Zen retreat, part picnic spot? Mix it up, have fun, and remember,
                     every patch of green has a story. What will yours be?</p>
