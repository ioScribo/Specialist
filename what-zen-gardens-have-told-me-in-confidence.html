						<h1 class="h2">What Zen Gardens Have Told Me</h1>
						<h2 class="h4">One on One, In Confidence</h2>
						<p>Okay! You might find that Japanese Zen dry gardens look simple: Just gravel, rocks, maybe a few
							shrubs. But after more than a decade of exploring and creating these spaces, I've learned they're
							anything but plain.</p>
						<p>At first, they can seem almost empty compared to colorful flower beds and lush lawns. But get
							closer, and they will tell you about their secrets. Like an iceberg, most of what matters is hidden
							beneath the surface.</p>
						<p>Japanese Zen dry gardens share a surprising similarity to the ancient Egyptian pyramids. Both are
							designed to guide the mind: One nudges us to reflect on the nature of reality and impermanence, the
							other points toward the mysteries of the soul and the universe. The pyramids use geometry and
							hidden passageways; Zen gardens use space, texture, and restraint.</p>
						<h3 class="h6">What Do I Know? And You Can Take Away From This?</h3>
						<p>Our senses are always demanding more, but Zen gardens just ask us to slow down. The act of raking
							gravel or arranging stones isn't just about making things look neat, but a means to clearing your
							mind and focus on the present. And if you'd rather just sit quietly and breathe, that's just as
							valid. </p>
						<p>There's no single recipe for building a Zen dry garden. It's about exploring, experimenting, and
							choosing elements that resonate with you. Whether you want a spot for quiet thought or just a break
							from high maintenance gardening, these spaces offer more than meets the eye.</p>
						<p>If you've spent time with a Zen garden, you know it has its own quiet way of teaching. Maybe you've
							noticed something unexpected, or found a small shift in how you see your space or even yourself. If
							you're just starting out, pay attention to what draws you in. There's no rush and no right answer.
							Sometimes, the most meaningful discoveries happen when you simply let the garden do the talking.
